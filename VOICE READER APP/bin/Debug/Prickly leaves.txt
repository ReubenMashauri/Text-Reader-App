At 10 o’clock Biff opened her gleaming, blue eyes and the key glowed. She
went in an enormous jungle and she touched prickly leaves. Some were
smooth and some were rough. They come in different sizes.
Biff heard lots of noise. She thought she heard a fierce lion, an enormous
giraffe and a nasty gorilla. Biff has a nice, fluffy, soft, bumpy and scary
jumper and some of the animals were scared of the jumper so they ran
away.
The children were walking in the jungle and saw a cute monkey. Kipper
said “Look everyone, there is a monkey,” then everyone was looking. The
children were scared but Kipper was not. He went closer to the monkey
but then the monkey got out a disgusting, mouldy and rotting orange.
Then the monkey threw the orange at Kipper and the children laughed at
Kipper.
The children were walking together but Kipper was walking by himself.
The others were going another way but Kipper was not looking. He got
caught in a net and he had to stay in the net for ten days. He was
shouting “HELP everyone!” At the end of the night there was an enormous
chinchilla on his head and he screamed.
On the last day some explorers helped Kipper and said “How are you?”
Then Kipper went with the explorers and then they came to a bridge and
Kipper fell and the explorers helped him. Kipper ran as fast as he could
then they got off before the bridge snapped.
They went up the steps and some nasty black bats came and they had to
duck. They came to the end of the steps but the lost city was not there.
Then Kipper said “I think it is this way. Let’s go.” So the explorers
followed Kipper and they came to the lost city. The explorers were so
excited because they had been looking for the lost city for years.
