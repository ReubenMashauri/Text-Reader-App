Under the magnifying glass, the ant looked pretty formidable. That means it looked large and scary
! As he followed the ant, he saw it fall into a small pit. The ant tried and tried to crawl out of
 the pit, but the sand kept giving way and he'd fall back down. Daryl was just about to give up on
 the ant when, all of a sudden, out of the bottom of the pit jumped an antlion and grabbed the ant
! Wow, was that something to watch up-close! The antlion was even more formidable than the ant!
