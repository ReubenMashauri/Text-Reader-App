In 1907, David Hurd moved from his hometown in Jamaica to New York City. The migration wasn’t easy
for the young man and he became terribly homesick. He missed his hometown and the company of his 
friends. In order to distract himself, David Hurd began searching for a potential pen-friend from 
his homeland. He found a woman called Avril Cato from the Caribbean who was interested in 
establishing a correspondence with him.The two slowly got to know each other, with one letter 
after the other. One year later, the two had fallen in love with each other, without having ever 
met. Seven years later, Avril and David met for the first time. It was the day before their 
wedding, as David had proposed to her shortly before. The two married and had six children.
