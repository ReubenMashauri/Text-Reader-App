It was a nice summer day and Daryl decided to go for a walk. 'Why don't you take that magnifying
 glass with you,' said his uncle, 'see what kind of an adventure you can find.' Daryl didn't 
think there was much adventure in a magnifying glass, but he stuck it in his pocket anyway along 
with some peanut butter crackers.He walked to his favorite tree and sat down in the warm sand to
 eat his crackers. As he ate, some crumbs fell to the ground. He took out the magnifying glass 
when he noticed an ant had already found his cracker crumbs. 'Hey,' he thought, 'I'll check this 
out.'
