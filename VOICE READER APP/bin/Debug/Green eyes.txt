Suddenly Biff opened his beautiful, green eyes and saw a
colourful jungle. The trees were as long as an elephant and
the bushes were as green as a frog. Biff is happy, pretty
and amazing. She is also brilliant and good and helps people
when they are hurt. When people are sad she goes and
makes them better and better.
Biff said “Look it’s a cute little monkey over there,” and
everyone looked. The monkey glared at them with his
beady eyes and got a mouldy, grey apple and started
throwing it at them. So they ran away and they found a
lion. The lion was chasing them and Chip said “Watch! It’s a
trap!” but Biff and Chip got grabbed. The net was grey,
mouldy and big and they got trapped in it for ten days then
the explorers came and found them. So they went to the
boat and went in the boat and they found some steps so
they went up the steps but they couldn’t find the lost city.
Chip whispered “Look, it’s a tunnel. Let’s go through it.” So
they went through a spider web and saw something glowing.
“Look it’s the lost city,” Chip said. They opened the door
and found lots of gold stuff. The gold shone and then the
key glowed so they went back home.
