When I was in high school, I was pretty quiet around people who weren’t my friends. The high 
school’s wrestling coach also taught geometry, and he was my teacher. This resulted in a lot of 
wrestlers skipping class and barging into our classroom to hang out and not get in trouble. One 
day, seven wrestlers come in yelling about new wrestling uniforms, and how excited they were. When
they go over and pull out the uniforms, the whole class is kind of side eyeing them. Even without
what I mention next, the suits look funny. I mean, it’s tight royal blue Spandex with a suspender
style top. Absolutely funny already. But the wrestlers grab the uniforms and rush out of the room
to go change in the bathroom, and come back to show them off. Which, is also hysterical because 
Spandex hides NOTHING; you could see all of their junk.Anyway, we live in a town called Ocean City
.It’s commonly abbreviated as “OC”. On the back of the Spandex uniform, it says Ocean City Men in
large letters. Except… they used the abbreviation. On the back, it says OC MEN. Which isn’t awful
,but then I sound it out in my head. OC MEN. Oh—semen. I almost spit out the water I was drinking.
I looked around frantically, trying to find out who I can tell, because I didn’t have any friends 
to tell in this class. I turn to the girl next to me, and I had no idea who she was and had never talked to her before. I told her what I found and we both cracked up.
The whole time she saw me as the quiet teacher’s pet who was shy as hell. The first words out of 
my mouth were “It says oh semen.”We’ve been best friends for 7 years now.
