It is the year 1975, when Charlotte Von Sledvin, a 19-year-old student of a Swedish royal family,
 travels to India to get a portrait made by a gifted artist. The artist was born into a poor 
Indian family of the lowest caste, also known as the “untouchables.” Despite the incredibly 
difficult circumstances, the artist named Pradyumna Kumar Mahanandia had gained an outstanding 
reputation for being a gifted painter. His reputation led Charlotte Von Sledvin to travel all the
 way to India to get her portrait done.By the time the portrait was finished, the two had fallen 
in love. Pradyumna was fascinated with Charlotte’s beauty. Never before had he seen a more 
beautiful woman from the Western world. He gave his best to capture all her beauty in the 
portrait, yet never fully succeeded. Nonetheless, the portrait was magnificent and Charlotte fell 
for his simplicity and his beautiful character. Because of him, she spontaneously decided to stay 
longer in India. Out of a couple of days became weeks and then even months. The two had fallen so 
deeply in love that they decided to get married according to traditional Indian rituals.
Unfortunately, the time came when Charlotte had to leave again in order to complete her studies in 
London. Thousands of miles separated the two but their feelings for each other never changed. They
stayed in contact through letters, which they exchanged almost weekly with each other. Naturally,
the newlyweds terribly struggled with the great distance between each other. Charlotte offered 
her husband to buy him air tickets, which he refused. He had not only decided to complete his 
studies first, but he had also set his mind on reuniting with the love of his life on his own 
terms. He even made her the promise that he would do anything he can to see her again.
After Pradyumna had finished his studies, he took all his possessions and sold them. 
Unfortunately, the money he earned didn’t even come close to a flight ticket. All he could afford 
was a cheap and used bicycle. Many would have been greatly disappointed, some would have even 
given up. But not Pradyumna. Instead of allowing the difficult circumstances to stop him from 
seeing his beloved wife again, he met the decision to use what he had in order to see her again. 
Nothing could stop him from reuniting with his wife, even if that meant an exhausting bicycle
ride half around the world.
His decision was the beginning of a bicycle journey from India to the Western world. Pradyumna took all his paintings and brushes along with him in order to financially support his endeavor. His voyage led him through eight countries and took more than four months. But eventually, he arrived at Charlotte’s hometown in Sweden and finally saw her again. From then on, the two did never leave each other’s side for too long.
